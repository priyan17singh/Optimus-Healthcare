# 🏥 Optimus Healthcare – Healthcare Services Web Prototype

This repository hosts a basic **prototype** of a healthcare services website called *Optimus Healthcare*. It demonstrates various user flows for Patients, Doctors, and Blood Bank services. While this version is static, the intention is to evolve into a fully dynamic and responsive web application.

## 🚀 Key Features & User Flows

### 1. Patient Module
- Users can log in as a patient (e.g. **ID**: `1234567891`, **Password**: same as ID)  
- View hospital appointments, patient history, prescriptions, and tele-medicine interfaces  
- Access modules for blood donor requests, emergency services, etc.

### 2. Doctor Module
- Login credentials example: **ID**: `565488782776`, **Password**: `mritesh108`  
- Doctors can view patient records, tele-medicine sessions, lab reports, etc.

### 3. Blood Bank Module
- Example login: **ID**: `bloodbank`, **Password**: `password`  
- Interfaces for donor registration, blood collection, inventory management, transfusion records

## ✅ What Works Now  
- Static UI flows for multiple user types (patient, doctor, blood-bank)  
- Navigation between sections: accounts, appointments, lab reports, donor modules  
- Authentication simulation with hard-coded credentials  

---

## 🔧 Planned Enhancements  
- Connect to a backend server and database for full CRUD operations  
- Implement secure authentication (JWT, OAuth)  
- Add dynamic dashboards for doctors/patients/blood-bank staff  
- Mobile-responsive layout and accessibility enhancements  
- Real-time chat/tele-medicine integration and notifications  
- Blood inventory analytics and donor matching algorithm
